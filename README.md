#### Problem Statement
Each day, thousands die due to medical negligence and delay in attending critical patients. Most of the time this is due to delay in completing pre-surgical procedures because of lack of nurses and a big volume of patients. 

You might have experienced the same. Remember going to see the doctor for a common cold and being told you can only see the doctor after completing the pre-requisite checks like height, weight, bmi, pulse, temperature, etc? Sometimes these procedures take more time than the actual appointment, not to mention the costs involved in getting these procedures done.

We aim at automating such procedures using **Computer Vision (OpenCV)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** technologies.	

#### How will we achieve this?
While the patient enters the hospital’s registration desk and fills in their required personal information, our cameras will record a short video of them. Using our technology, we will then predict their height, weight, pulse, temperature, etc. 

The error will be marginal and will only improve with time.

#### Proof of concept
It has been proven time and again that automation is the future. Take factories, for example. Each year the amount of automated robots in factories increases by a huge number. In India alone, the number of industrial robots in factories increased by 4300 units in the year 2019. (source-https://ifr.org/ifr-press-releases/news/record-2.7-million-robots-work-in-factories-around-the-globe).

We believe that automation in hospital procedures is highly required. This will save not only the precious time, but also the lives of the critical patients. 

We are not limited to temperature, height, weight and pulse check-ups. With time, we will be able to automate a lot of other checkups, including critical ones before a surgery.

#### Script
Let me walk you through a hypothetical scenario: imagine you had too much ice cream last night and you wake up in the morning and find yourself sneezing. You can't deal with it anymore and you decide to visit a doctor.

But you find yourself spending more time completing the pre-consultation check-ups (like getting your temperature, pulse or BMI checked) than the actual appointment? Worry not, introducing I.V.C. (that is, Instant vital checkup). 

Now, no need to stand in those long queues, we’ve got you covered! We do all these checkups automatically while you book your appointment at the registration desk. 

We use Computer Vision and Machine Learning technologies to achieve this! We do all this with little to no error.

#### Let me walk you through the procedure
1)We need 3 cameras for this procedure. <br />
2)One will be at a large distance behind the registration desk for measuring height and weight. <br />
3)One will be up-close to your face which will note your pulse. <br />
4)The last camera would be an infrared camera that will note your temperature. <br />
5)These cameras will record you and subsequently update your report with your respective test results using our algorithms <br />
6)Now, you can directly head over to your assigned doctor. <br />

#### Flaws
Like any new innovative idea, there are some flaws associated with our idea as well, they are: <br />
1)Inaccurate measurement of data in report. <br />
2)If someone else does the registration of a critical patient, then our plan of action will fail. <br />
3)Method of protocol for disabled people is not safe proof. <br />

#### Future
What we plan on doing in the future: <br />
1)Expand to hospitals worldwide. <br />
2)Start doing diagnosis for many basic diseases and structural deformities. <br />
3)Expanding into developing models that predict diseases based on symptoms. <br />
